 * You will learn how to use the JavaScript Array some() method to check if at least one element in the array

 * 
 * Introduction to the JavaScript Array some() method
 * Sometimes, you want to check if an array has at least one element that meets a specified condition.
 */

 //- For example, to check if the following array has at least one element less than 5:
 let marks = [ 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 3 ];

 //- …you typically use a for loop, like this:
 let marks = [ 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 3 ];
 
 let lessThanFive = false;
 
 for (let index = 0; index < marks.length; index++) {
     if (marks[index] < 5) {
         lessThanFive = true;
         break;
     }
 }
 
 console.log(lessThanFive);
 Output:
 
 true
 
 /**
  * 
  * How it works:
 First, declare a flag variable lessThanFive and set its value to false.
 Second, iterate over the elements. If an element is less than 5, set the flag to true and immediately exit the 
 loop using the break statement. The code works as expected. However, it is quite verbose.
 The Array type provides you with an instance method called some() that allows you to test if an array has at 
 least one element that meets a condition.
  */
 
 let marks = [ 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 3 ];
 
 lessThanFive = marks.some(function(e) {
     return e < 5;
 });
 
 //- The Array type provides you with an instance method called some() that allows you to test if an array has 
 //  at least one element that meets a condition.
 console.log(lessThanFive);
 
 Output:
 
 true
 
 //- Now, the code is shorter. To make it more expressive, you can use the arrow function syntax in ES6:
 
 let marks = [ 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 3 ];
 
 let lessThanFive = marks.some(e => e < 5);
 
 console.log(lessThanFive);
 
 /**
  * 1) The callback argument
 The some() function executes the callback function once for each element in the array until it finds the one where 
 the callback function returns a true. The some() method immediately returns true and doesn’t evaluate the remaining 
 elements.
 If no element causes the callback() to return true, the some() method returns false.
 The callback function takes three arguments:
  */
 function callback(currentElement , [[ currentIndex], array]){ }
 
 
 /**
  * The currentElement is the current element being processed in the array.
 The currentIndex is the index of the current element being processed in the array.
 The array is array that some() was called upon.
 2) The thisArg argument
 The thisArg argument is optional. If you pass the thisArg into the method, you can use the thisArg as the 
 this value inside the callback function.
  */
 
 // 1) Check if an element exists in the array
 // The following exists() function uses the some() method to check if a value exists in an array:
 
 function exists(value, array) {
     return array.some(e => e === value);
 }
 
 let marks = [4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 2];
 
 console.log(exists(4, marks));
 console.log(exists(11, marks));
 
 Output:
 
 true
 false
 
 // 2) Check if an array has one element that is in a range
 // The following example shows how to check if any number in the marks array is in the range of (8, 10):
 
 let marks = [4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 2];
 
 const range = {
     min: 8,
     max: 10
 };
 
 let result = marks.some(function (e) {
     return e >= this.min && e <= this.max;
 }, range);
 
 console.log(result);
 
 Output:
 
 true
 
 //- If you call the some() method on an empty array, the result is always false regardless of any condition. For example:
 
 let result = [].some(e => e > 0);
 console.log(result);
 
 result = [].some(e => e <= 0);
 console.log(result);
 
 Output:
 
 false
 false
