/**
 * 
 * @requires Array.sort() You will learn how to use the JavaScript Array sort() method to sort arrays of numbers, 
 * string, and objects.
 * 
 * 
 * The sort() method allows you to sort elements of an array in place. Besides returning the sorted array, the 
 * sort() method changes the positions of the elements in the original array.
 */

//-Consider the following example:

let numbers = [0, 1 , 2, 3, 10, 20, 30 ];
numbers.sort();
console.log(numbers);

Output:

[ 0, 1, 10, 2, 20, 3, 30 ]

//- In this example, the sort() method places 10 before 2 because the string “10” comes before “2” when doing 
//  a string comparison.

//- To fix this, you need to pass a compare function to the sort() method. The sort() method will use the compare 
//- function to determine the orders of elements.

array.sort(comparefunction)

/**
 * The compare() function accepts two arguments a and b. The sort() method will sort elements based on 
 * the return value of the compare() function with the following rules:
If compare(a,b) is less than zero, the sort() method sorts a to a lower index than b. In other words, a will come first.
If compare(a,b) is greater than zero, the sort() method sort b to a lower index than a, i.e., b will come first.
If compare(a,b) returns zero, the sort() method considers a equals b and leaves their positions unchanged.
 */

//- To fix the issue of sorting the number, you can use the following syntax:

let numbers = [0, 1 , 2, 3, 10, 20, 30 ];
numbers.sort( function( a , b){
    if(a > b){
        return 1;
    }; 
    if(a < b){
        return -1
    };
    return 0;
});

console.log(numbers);

Output:

[ 0,  1,  2, 3, 10, 20, 30 ]

//- Or you can define the comparison function using the arrow function syntax:

let numbers = [0, 1 , 2, 3, 10, 20, 30 ];
numbers.sort((a,b) => {
    if(a > b) return 1;
    if(a < b) return -1;
    return 0;
});

console.log(numbers);

/**
 * Sorting an array of strings
Suppose you have an array of string named animals as follows:
 */

let animals = [
    'cat', 'dog', 'elephant', 'bee', 'ant'
];

/**
 * To sort the elements of the animals array in ascending order alphabetically, you use the sort() method without 
 * passing the compare function as shown in the following example:
 */

let animals = [
    'cat', 'dog', 'elephant', 'bee', 'ant'
];
animals.sort();

console.log(animals);

Output:

[ 'ant', 'bee', 'cat', 'dog', 'elephant' ]

/**
 * To sort the animals array in descending order, you need to change the logic of the compare function and pass 
 * it to the sort() method as the following example.
 */

let animals = [
    'cat', 'dog', 'elephant', 'bee', 'ant'
];

animals.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a > b)
        return -1;
    if (a < b)
        return 1;
    return 0;
});

console.log(animals);

Output:

[ 'elephant', 'dog', 'cat', 'bee', 'ant' ]

//-  you have an array that contains elements in both uppercase and lowercase as follows:

// sorting array with mixed cases
let mixedCaseAnimals = [
    'Cat', 'dog', 'Elephant', 'bee', 'ant'
];

/**
 * To sort this array alphabetically, you need to use a custom compare function to convert all elements to the same case e.g., 
 * uppercase for comparison and pass that function to the sort() method.
 */

let mixedCaseAnimals = [
    'Cat', 'dog', 'Elephant', 'bee', 'ant'
];

mixedCaseAnimals.sort(function (a, b) {
    let x = a.toUpperCase(),
        y = b.toUpperCase();
    return x == y ? 0 : x > y ? 1 : -1;

});

Output:

[ 'ant', 'bee', 'Cat', 'dog', 'Elephant' ]


/**
 * 
 * Sorting an array of strings with non-ASCII characters
The sort() method is working fine with the strings with ASCII characters. However, for the strings with non-ASCII characters e.g., 
é, è, etc., the sort() method will not work correctly. For example:
 */

let animaux = ['zèbre', 'abeille', 'écureuil', 'chat'];
animaux.sort();

console.log(animaux);

// To resolve this, you use the localeCompare() method of the String object to compare strings in a specific locale, 
// like this:

animaux.sort(function (a, b) {
    return a.localeCompare(b);
});
console.log(animaux);

Output:

[ 'abeille', 'chat', 'écureuill', 'zèbree' ]

/**
 * Sorting an array of numbers
Suppose you have an array of numbers named scores as in the following example.
 */

let scores = [

let scores = [
    9, 80, 10, 20, 5, 70
];
// sort numbers in ascending order
scores.sort((a, b) => a - b);

console.log(scores);

Output:

[ 5, 9, 10, 20, 70, 80 ]

//- To sort an array of numbers numerically in descending order, you just need to 
//  reverse the logic in the compare function as shown in the following example:

let scores = [
    9, 80, 10, 20, 5, 70
];
// descending order
scores.sort((a, b) => b - a);
console.log(scores);

Output:

[80, 70, 20, 10, 9, 5]

Here is the solution:
