/**
 * @requires indexOf()  will show you how to use the JavaScript array indexOf() and lastIndexOf() methods to 
 * find the position of an element in an array.
 */

// The following illustrates the syntax of the indexOf() method.

Array.indexOf(searchElement, fromIndex)

/**
 * As shown above, the indexOf() method accepts two named arguments.
The searchElement argument is the element that you want to find in the array.
The fromIndex is an array index at which the function starts the search.
The fromIndex argument can be a positive or negative integer. If the fromIndex argument is negative, the indexOf() 
method starts searching at array’s length plus fromIndex.
 */

//- Suppose, you have an array scores that consists of six numbers as follows:

let scores = [10, 20, 30, 10, 40, 20];

//- The following example uses the indexOf() method to find the elements in the scores array:

console.log(scores.indexOf(10)); // 0
console.log(scores.indexOf(30)); // 2
console.log(scores.indexOf(50)); // -1
console.log(scores.indexOf(20)); // 1

//- Assuming that you have the following array of objects, where each object has two properties: name and age.

let guests = [
    {name: 'John Doe', age: 30},
    {name: 'Lily Bush', age: 20},
    {name: 'William Gate', age: 25}
];

// The following statement returns -1 even though the first element of the guests array and the searchElement have the 
// same values in the name and ages properties. This is because they are two different objects.

console.log(guests.indexOf({
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 30
})); // -1


// Sometimes, you want to find the indices of all occurrences of an element in an array. The following find() 
// function uses the indexOf() method to do so.

function find(needle, haystack) {
    let results = [];
    let idx = haystack.indexOf(needle);
    while (idx != -1) {
        results.push(idx);
        idx = haystack.indexOf(needle, idx + 1);
    }
    return results;
}

// The following example uses the find() function above to return an array of positions of the number 10 in the 
// scores array.

console.log(find(10,scores)); // [0, 3]

/**
 * 
 * JavaScript array lastIndexOf() method
The Array type has another method called lastIndexOf() that provides the similar functionality to the indexOf() method.
The following illustrates the syntax of the lastIndexOf() method:
 */
Array.lastIndexOf(searchElement , [fromIndex = Array.length - 1])

/**
 * The lastIndexOf() method returns the index of the last occurrence of the searchElement in the array. It returns -1 
 * if it cannot find the element.
Different from the indexOf() method, the lastIndexOf() method searches for the element backward, starting at fromIndex.
The following statements return the last indices of the number 10 and 20 in the scores array.
 */

console.log(scores.lastIndexOf(10));// 3
console.log(scores.lastIndexOf(20));// 5
